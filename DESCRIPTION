Description: Provides an interface to the GUDHI library which is a generic open 
  source C++ library, with a Python interface, for topological data analysis 
  (TDA) and higher dimensional geometry understanding. The library offers 
  state-of-the-art data structures and algorithms to construct simplicial 
  complexes and compute persistent homology.
